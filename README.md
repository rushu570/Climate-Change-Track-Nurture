# Climate-Change-Track-Nurture

We deployed a smart contract on rinkeby ethereum network which stores the ipfs hash of the document hosted on a decentralized Interplanetary FileSystem.
We do this because hosting a document in general on a blockchain is an expensive affair. We can address large amount of data with ipfs and place the immutable, permanent ipfs links into a blockchain transaction.
This timestamps and secures the documents on an immutable ledger and can be sent to the intended person in the form of an ipfs hash.

To get the image from the ipfs hash:

Go to this website: https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/*hash*
